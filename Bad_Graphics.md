# Bad Graphics
If you have been redirected here from Principia, it means your game is running at reduced graphical fidelity.

This could be because your device is too old, or because the game crashed while loading.

This can be disabled by editing your settings manually. For Windows, the settings file is found in `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\Principia\settings.ini`.

In the file, change the line that says:

`is_very_shitty = 1`

to

`is_very_shitty = 0`
