## TODOs
- [X] ~~Archive images.~~ Done. All images have been archived and link to this archive. [Imgur images have been archived](https://archive.org/details/images.7z_202003), but will be linked to Imgur until they go down.
- [ ] Some more format tweaks perhaps?
- [ ] Object pages, atm only LuaScript is done.
	- [ ] Objects list page.
- [ ] Recover linked community levels.
	- Currently, only 41% of the linked community levels exist in the community level archive. This is most likely even lower as this doesn't take into account levels on object pages.
- [ ] Archive non-Bithack videos for preservation.
