# Damper
Damper/shock absorber. Both ends can be attached to other objects, either in the same layer as the damper or to objects in neighbouring layers.

The damper has two configurable properties: Pressure and maximum speed. Pressure is the amount of force that the damper is able to apply to return to its equilibrium. The maximum speed controls how fast the damper responds. A lower maximum speed produces a soft response, while a higher maximum speed produces a more bouncy behaviour.
