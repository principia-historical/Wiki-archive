# Magnetic plug
Automatically attaches itself to nearby Magnetic Socket. If connected, the value received from the Magnetic Socket is forwarded to **`OUT0`**.

The alternative source (**`IN0`**) is used if the plug is not connected to a socket. The value received from **`IN0`** will then be output through **`OUT0`**. As soon as the plug is connected to a magnetic socket, the alternative source is no longer used until the plug disconnects again.

- **`OUT0`**: Recevied signal
- **`IN0`**: Alternative source
