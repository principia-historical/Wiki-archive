# Receiver
Listens for a signal on the given frequency.

The receiver will differentiate between broadcast signals and transmitter signals, and prefer transmitter signals. That means if a broadcaster is broadcasting a value of 0.5 over the receivers frequency, and a transmitter is transmitting the value 1.0, the receiver will receive 1.0.
