# Cursor finder
Outputs the angle and distance to the cursor, or if on a mobile device, to the first finger that's pressed down on the screen. The angle and distance are saved, so it can be used as a "last touch position" for mobile devices.

Advanced help:
- **`OUT0`**: Angle
- **`OUT1`** Distance
