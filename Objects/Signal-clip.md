# Signal clip
Cable clip for signal cables (red cables). The cable clip allows you to drag signal cables along other objects. The signal is passed through the clip without modification.

Both sides of the clip can be attached to other objects.

## User Information
The poor little Signal Clip, all it seems to do is pass a signal from In0 to Out0 with no apparent purpose... Here's what else it can do.

It is very small and can be nailed on all four sides, making it ideal for connecting things together that dont quite reach or strengtening connections like the [[Corner]] object.

A Signal clip is perfect for setting a [[Mini transmitter]] signal with a [[Jumper]].

Long messy wires can be made into multiple sections by splicing them together with Signal clips, allowing you to run the wires along other paths by nailing the Signal clips out of the way.

When saving groups of objects with multiselect signal clips wired to each object group allow you to temporarily connect things or multiple layered groupings.

This is also a good method for auto absorbing different groups of objects with a single signal.  Both sides of a damper can be connected this way in a cramped spot behind a tire.

See the object description for the [[Signal Cable]] for the basics of signaling in Principia.
