# XOR gate
Binary device. If a value of 1 is read from **`IN0`** or **`IN1`**, but not from both at the same time, the XOR gate outputs 1. Otherwise it outputs 0.

## User Information
XOR Gate:

Wired with Signal Cables, the XOR Gate will send a signal through the Output socket if one of the imputs sends a signal. If both are pressed the Output signal is stopped.

Example:

```
Button--(IN1)--XOR Gate--(IN0)--Button
                  /
                 /
               Motor--Battery
```

If one of the Buttons is pressed, the motor will activate, if the second one is also pressed it will deactivate again.
