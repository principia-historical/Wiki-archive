# Magnetic socket
Automatically attaches itself to nearby Magnetic Plug.

If magnetically connected, the input signal (**`IN0`**) is sent to the connected magnetic plug. If no magnetic plug is connected, the signal is instead sent to **`OUT0`**. When a magnetic socket is connected, 0 is always sent to the alternative output (**`OUT0`**).

- **`IN0`**: Input signal
- **`OUT0`**: Alternative output
