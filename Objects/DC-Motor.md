# DC Motor
DC motor. Power this motor by connecting it to a controller (CT) using an interface cable (blue cable). For more information on how to use motors, open up the object description of CT Mini.

Any side of the motor can be attached to nearby objects.

Characteristics:
* High maximum speed
* Speed control with constant torque 
* No engine braking

__NOTE:__

Since this motor is not capable of keeping its idle position or slowing down, it might oscillate if interfacing with a CT Servo. For precise angle control, the Servo Motor should be used instead.
