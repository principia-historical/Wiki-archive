# Object field
Use the crosshair button to select an object. All objects of that type will be detected by the field. When an object of the selected type enters the field, 1.0 is reported through OUT0, otherwise 0.0 is reported. For example, select a metal ball and all metal balls will trigger the object field. The object field ignores properties such as the size of cylinders.
