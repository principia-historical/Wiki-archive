# Servo Motor
A motor that is good for precise angle control or abrupt speed control. Power this motor by connecting it to a controller (CT) using an interface cable (blue cable).

Characteristics:
* Low maximum speed
* High torque
* A desired speed below the current speed slows down (brakes) the motor
* Applies torque to hold its idle position or desired angle

By default, the 0-angle is set to the initial angle of the motor. The pink rotary icon can be used to adjust the initial offset to the 0-angle. For example, if you align the pink rotary icon with what you have connected to the motor, the offset will return the 0-angle to point right. For absolute angle control, you should always align the pink rotary icon with what you have connected.
