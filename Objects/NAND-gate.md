# NAND gate
Binary device. Same as the AND gate, but the output value is inverted.

## User Information
NAND Gate:

Wired with Signal Cables, the NAND Gate(Negated AND) will send a signal through the Output socket if both Inputs receive a signal. However it begins in the opposite state as the AND Gate.

Example:

```
Button--(IN1)--NAND Gate--(IN0)--Button
                   /
                  /
                Motor--Battery
```

Both Buttons must be pressed to deactivate the Motor.
