# Jumper
Plug this into a signal socket to set the signal to a constant value.

## User Information
Plug a Jumper into any IN socket to provide a continuous stream of the signal strength of your choice.

Currently(1.3.0.3) the Jumper can be set to 0.05 increments, the Gear icon will allow some further precision settings, to create other numbers not on the scale use these methods.

0.01 increments = 1.0 jumper set on a [[sub]] component, use the Sub slider to subtract from 1.0 to obtain the value you need. Sub outputs the result.

0.005 increments, for example to establish a perfect 45 degree angle you need a signal value of .125, Place a .10 and .15 jumper on an [[Avg]] Gate, this will output the average, 0.125

See the object description of the [[Signal Cable]] for the basics of signaling in Principia. -zardOz
