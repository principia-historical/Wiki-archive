# Shape Extruder
Attach this object to another object, the shape extruder will expand the sides of the other shape. The expanded area collides only with dynamic objects, and does not collide with static objects such as platforms, pixels, etc.

Use the Shape Extruder to prevent very fast moving objects from passing through each other.
