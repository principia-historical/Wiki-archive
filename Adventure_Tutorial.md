# Adventure Tutorial
This page is mainly directed to players trying out "start a new adventure" under the Play category. If you're using the sandbox, simply click the description button for each object for a detailed description. Also, check out the [Tutorials](Tutorials) wiki page for detailed beginner tutorials.

When you start a new adventure you'll begin as a basic robot with no robot front or back and only an **Arm Cannon** as weapon to aid you in combat. You might want to upgrade your robot so that it has some armor and a stronger weapon. To do that, you can learn how to use the tools and objects that are listed below.

## Basic Starting Tools

### Builder
The builder tool allows you to move and attach objects. It's useful when you want to build a house or a vehicle or e.g drag an object to the **Repair station**.

### Zapper
The Zapper is very useful when you want to collect resources or explore caves under the ground. This tool allows you to mine, collect wood from cutting down trees and gather other resources from destroying ores and junk objects.

## Basic Starting Objects
Below are descriptions for some objects that you will find already placed out in the world.

### Factory
The factory lets the robot use resources to build objects. When the Factory is clicked, a menu pops up where you can select what objects to build.

### Oil Rig
The Oil Rig gathers oil from the ground and collects it into oil barrels that the player can use as a resource for building things.

### Repair Station
The repair station lets you repair and equip any type of robot with items. You want to replace the robot head with a cow head? Simply drag it to the blue antenna using the builder tool, then walk in front of the repair station. If you want to equip it to a non-player robot/animal, just climb the ladder and use the monitor while it is standing in front of the repair station. If you have a **Faction wand** you can use that to command it.
