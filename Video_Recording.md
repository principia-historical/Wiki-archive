# Video Recording
To record a video of Principia, just follow these simple steps.

## Download a Video Recording Software
We'll use a free and open source software called **Open Broadcaster Software**. This software is mainly used for live broadcasting but can be used for video recording as well.

You can download it here:

## Recording a Video of Principia
Open up a level in Principia that you want to record.

Click the *Settings* button in **Open Broadcaster Software**.

Once in the settings window, select *Broadcast Settings* from the list on the left.

On the right at the very top change the option *Mode* from *Live Stream* to *File Output Only*. (see screeshot below)

Set the *File Path* to where the recorded video will be saved. **Open Broadcaster Software** does not overwrite files, it adds (#) to the end of each duplicate file, where # is a number counting up from 1.
